# Binary Trees and Binary Search Trees Implementation

The Binary Trees and Binary Search Trees Implementation is a Java program that demonstrates the usage and functionality of Binary Trees and Binary Search Trees. The application contains several classes, including `Node`, `BinaryTree`, and `BinarySearchTree`, which implement the respective data structures and their associated operations.

## Application Overview

The application consists of the following main components:

1. `Node` class: Represents a node object with value, left child, and right child properties for use in the Binary Trees and Binary Search Trees.
2. `BinaryTree` class: Implements a Binary Tree data structure with methods for depth-first traversals, including pre-order, in-order, and post-order traversals.
3. `BinarySearchTree` class: Implements a Binary Search Tree data structure, which is a subclass of the BinaryTree class, with additional methods for adding new nodes and checking if a value is present in the tree.
4. `BinaryTreeTests` class: Contains JUnit Jupiter tests for validating the functionality of the BinaryTree and BinarySearchTree classes.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you get the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following software installed:

- Java JDK 8 or later
- Gradle

### Installing

1. Clone the repository:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/CodrCam/java-trees.git
    cd java-trees
    ```

2. Build the project:

   `$ gradle build`

## Running the Tests

To run the tests for the application, use the following command:

`$ gradle test`

The tests will validate the functionality of the BinaryTree and BinarySearchTree classes, ensuring proper operation of depth-first traversal methods, adding new nodes, and checking for the presence of a value in the tree.
